# inspiring-booth

This project is a proof of concept showing the integration with TravisCI and CircleCI to execute
the "tests" on each commit, from any possible branch for this project.

It also deploys the application on inspiring-booth.surge.sh if the build is passing and
it's a merge request into the master branch.
